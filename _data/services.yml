  description: "<p>Manicure came from the Latin word Manus meaning hands and, again cura, meaning care. So manicure is the care of the hands. In a manicure your fingernails are trimmed (if desired), soaked in a finger bowl with warm soapy water, filed, and ridges are buffed off the surface of the nail. The cuticles are softened, pushed back, and possibly removed. Dirt is cleaned out from under the free edge (the part that hangs over and extends beyond your fingers) of your nails and brushed with a nail brush. As is the surface of your nails. A hand massage is performed with lotion and in some cases an arm massage too. Then fingernails are painted with a base coat, two coats of desired color, and a top coat. That's a basic manicure.</p>"
